Robo BennieF is back this year with his robot pirate army. He looks over the bow, as a white whale breaches the surface and with a blast of sea water, launches a book into the air. He wipes the liquid from his sensors to find a watterlogged copy of 20,000 Leagues grasped between his servos.

1a. He glances over the soaking cover, it reads, "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under 0xAAA Sea by Jules Verne" `checksum: 8fc42c6ddf9966db3b09e84365034357`
2b. Opening the book, he finds an inscription: "Major Andr√©, ptIchVIIpa26l5w11 -RoboBenedict" What a treacherous message.

3c. With the previous clue deciphered, at the bottom of the page, he notices another note "Give me liberfy ir give me death" in the footer.  What a peculiar thing to write?

4d. Quickly flipping through the pages, he discovers a note in the margin of a page: "Turn to the penultimate chapter and read about the 4 directions, where 17 bots ventured, through 24 islands for 46 nights and 47 days to find 66 barrels filled with robo-joint grease #71 in the resting place of Captain N."

5e. Frustrated by these nonsensical messages, RoboBen shakes the book. It becomes unbound and he discovers the text `4d3c1a2b` inscribed into the spine.
