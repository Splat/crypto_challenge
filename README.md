## Hints
If you're having trouble, here are some tips to ensure you're calculating the checksum the same way we did:

- It's an MD5 checksum
- The answers are all lower case
- Remember to remove new lines when checking checksums!

On *nix/OSX systems, you should get the correct checksum with:

```
md5 -s "YOUR_ANSWER"
```

If you'd rather just use an online tool, [this should suffice](https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/)
